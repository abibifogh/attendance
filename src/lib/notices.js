 * reasons it exists alongside the mail rather than instead of it — somebody who
 * lives in the app should not have to open an inbox to find out that four days
 * are waiting on them, and when the mail fails, this is what still says so.
 *
 * Nothing here ever throws at its caller. A notice is a courtesy; failing to
 * record one must not fail the round that earned it.
