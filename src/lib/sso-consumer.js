/**
 * Arriving here already signed in, from the group's hub.
 *
 * The hub does not send us a person. It sends an opaque code, and we call the
 * hub back — server to server — with that code and our own shared secret, and
 * it tells us who the code was for. Then we make one of our own ordinary
 * sessions, exactly as if they had typed their password here.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does not do.
 *
 * It does not trust anything in the URL. The code carries no identity; it is
 * thirty-two random bytes that the hub is willing to exchange, once, for a name
 * and an address. A URL ends up in a browser history, a proxy log and a
 * `Referer` header, and none of those should ever have contained somebody's
 * identity.
 *
 * It does not create accounts. If the hub says "this is ama@example.com" and
 * nobody here is ama@example.com, the answer is no — with a message saying so.
 * Auto-provisioning would mean whoever controls the hub can mint themselves an
 * account in the attendance system, and the whole point of a separate grant per
 * system is that reaching one is not reaching all of them.
 *
 * It does not widen anybody. The role the hub sends is ignored for permissions:
 * what somebody may do here is what their row in this database says, as it
 * always was. The hand-off decides *whether* they get in, never *as what*.
